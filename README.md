# first-django-admin

A step-by-step guide to creating a simple web application that empowers you to enlist reporters in data entry and refinement.

This 3-hour, hands-on tutorial will teach you how to take advantage of the Django Web framework's powerful administration panel, without bothering with all the other web developer crap.

You will learn how to design database tables, load in data and quickly create a system for others to improve it. Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.

While still incomplete, this lesson is scheduled to be presented for the first time at [the National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting's 2015 conference](http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2015/hands-on-training/) in Atlanta on March 8.
